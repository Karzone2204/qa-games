 Description: There is a request for a further integration of inspection request messges between IGP and EH/MTU. Currently, we generate the messages when our orders are cancelled.  However, they want to integrate inspection requests for orders which are proceeding as a repair.  I have put together some overall requirements in the attached document. As yet, we have not got into details of mapping a content of messages. However, I am raising this to the backlog so it can go in for initial review  ------------------------------------  I think there would also be some UI changes for inspection requests after allocation. Currently on the UI when inspection requested date is populated, the inspection scheduled date is mandatory. When the inspection requests are integrated, we are not going to know/get back the date the inspection is arranged for at the point we send the request- so this would require some UI changes I think.  The following section will outline the business case and assist with sprint planning:Business Case:
